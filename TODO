CLASSIFICATION TASK
    1) LOSS FUNCTIONS 
    - Cross Entropy for Upper Body Clothing                  (done)
    -     //        for Lower Body Clothing                  (done)
    -     //        for Age Attribute                        (done)
    - Binary Cross Entropy for Independent Binary Attributes (done)

    2) NORMALIZATION
    - mean and std value 4each channel                       (done)
    - batch normalization layers

    3) ARCHITECTURES
    - lenet (with BatchNorm)                                 (unfeasible, you'll lose imagenet pretrained weights)
    - alexnet (with BatchNorm)                               (unfeasible, you'll lose imagenet pretrained weights)
    - resnet (different versions)                            (done)
    - densenet                                               (done)

    4) ATTENTION
    - custom attention maps stacked to a common backbone     (done)
    
    5) PARAMETER TWEAKING AND OPTIMIZER
    - based on winning nn (finetuning vs feature_extraction, docs here: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/finetuning_torchvision_models_tutorial.html)
                                                             (done)

    6) ADDITIONAL/OPTIONAL
    - person detector to discard distractor and junk images
    - precision, recall and f-score

    7) ??? Implement Random Forest Classifier ???
    8) Generate 'classification_test.csv'


REIDENTIFICATION TASK
    1) TBD
